# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project repository. This project aims to build and evaluate models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning techniques.


## Project Description
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task in the financial sector, aiming to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. This project uses a dataset of credit card transactions to build and evaluate models for detecting fraud. The models used in this project include Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree classifiers.


## Objectives
* Preprocess the credit card transaction data.
* Explore and visualize the data to understand its structure.
* Build and evaluate machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.
* Compare the performance of different models.


## Project Structure
The project is divided into the following tasks:

### Task 1: Data Preprocessing
* Load and clean the dataset.
* Handle missing values and scale the features.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualize the distribution of classes (fraud vs. non-fraud).
* Analyze the correlation between features.
* Plot the data to identify patterns and anomalies.

### Task 3: Model Building and Evaluation
* Build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
* Build a Decision Tree classifier.
* Train the models on the training data.
* Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Task 4: Model Comparison
* Compare the performance of the SVM and Decision Tree models.
* Identify the best model based on evaluation metrics.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of credit card transactions, with each transaction labeled as either fraud or non-fraud. The features in the dataset include various transaction details and anonymized attributes.
